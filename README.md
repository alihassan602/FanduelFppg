Cocoapods required for project, run
```pod install```


Test was done using the VIPER architecture

Given more time I would likely add an initial screen in, where the data download would be done and allow the user to select the number of players to choose between.
I would then enable a button to let them progress to the next screen and use a collectionView to display the amount of players that was selected initially

I would also show the answer state(green/red) in the cell selected 
Have a stand out headerview that would display the current score and the "WIN" message more clearly to the user
